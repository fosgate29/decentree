## Why decenTREElized ?

In Brazil, a ghost bird was found in 2015. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-eyed_ground_dove"> blue-eye dove</a>. Bird watchers organization from UK donated some funds and bought the area were it was found to preserve it. It is in rural area, very poor community, with little resources. 

What called our attention was after this bird was found, the small community improved a little bit. And it wasn't a huge amount of investments, with ads, TVs, artists posting in X.com about it. Because since it is a rare bird, it is a very controlled area. Tourists cannot go there. Only a small amount of researchers can go there and take some pictures of the bird. 

But only a few persons going to the area per month improved community life. Hotel owner has 2 more rooms per month occupied. Hotel is spending more in food. Supermarket sells a little bit more. Gas station also is selling more gas per month. It isn't million of dollars, but a small amount of money. And that improved the community and now they want to preserve the bird. It improved their life.

That's why we thought about decenTREElized. In Brazil, each farm must preserve 20% of the land. That area is only costs for some small and poor farmers. They don't have interest in it. If it burns, they don't care. So if a poor farmer could show its area, with some pictures, some videos, a donator could send a small amount of money per year. Like 50 dolllars. We didn't make the math yet. What we have in mind is: Donator gives 1 Ether. 0.1 Ether per year is sent to the small farmer. Farmer should post some pictures so donator is happy with the donation. In case donator doesn't want to keep on donating money, it is possible to call **refund()** function and donator would receive back the balance remained. For example, after 2 years, donator executes **refund()** and would get back 0.8 Ether. 

## Next steps

1. Improve smart contracts. After a stable version of the smart contract, deploy on mainnet
2. Add more functionalities in the frontend. Donator should be able to see pictures of the area. Farmer should be able to upload pictures, type some text about the area. Farmer must show he is doing a good job preserving the area so donator doesn't ask for a refund. 
3. Develop the economic part. Since it is a donation that farmer would use 10% per year only, the remaining balance is parked in the smart contract doing nothing. Maybe it is a good a idea to stake or something else. It is also important to think about a fee to mantain the application.
4. Improve frontend code
5. Add more map control, explore Google Maps API
6. Create a X.com account and talk about the project, spread the word.
